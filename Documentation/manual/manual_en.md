# Ver. 20 RealitySim AI User Manual

_Welcome to **RealitySim AI**, an interactive web-based simulation environment where AI agents with unique beliefs, memories, and psychological profiles interact within a dynamic world. This application allows you to observe emergent cognitive and social behavior, control agents with natural language, run simulation steps, and visualize the complex dynamics of the system.

RealitySim AI solves the problem of understanding complex system behaviors by providing a sandbox for emergent AI. It's not a game to be won, but a tool for observation and experimentation. You can witness the formation of cultures, the evolution of social structures, and how individual traumas and goals shape a community's destiny. Dive deep into the minds of your agents, influence their actions, or simply watch their world unfold._

## 1. Getting Started

RealitySim AI is a browser-based application, meaning there's no complex installation process. You simply open the application in your web browser.

### 1.1. Running the Application
To run the application locally:
1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project's root directory, and run `npm install`.
3.  **Set up API Key:** The AI agents' intelligence is powered by an external AI provider. For Google Gemini, you **must** set your Gemini API key as an environment variable named `API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` in a `.env.local` file in the project's root directory.
    *   Example `.env.local` content:
        ```
        API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
4.  **Launch the Application:** Run `npm run dev` in your terminal. This will start a local development server, and the application will open in your default web browser.

### 1.2. Configuring AI Providers
The core intelligence of the agents is driven by an AI model. You can configure this via the **Settings Modal** (accessible by clicking the `‚öôÔ∏è Settings` icon in the top right corner).

*   **Google Gemini (Recommended):**
    *   **Functionality:** Offers the most advanced features, including the creation of vector embeddings for long-term memory.
    *   **Configuration:** Requires a Google AI API key. This key is read from your environment variables (as set in `1.1. Running the Application`). You select the desired Gemini model from a dropdown list (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`).

*   **LM Studio:**
    *   **Functionality:** An alternative for users who prefer to run models locally on their machine.
    *   **Configuration:**
        1.  **Start LM Studio Server:** Launch your LM Studio application and start a local server within it.
        2.  **Enter Server URL:** Input the displayed server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:1234`) into the `LM Studio API Endpoint` field in RealitySim AI's settings.
        3.  **Specify Model Name:** Enter the API identifier of the loaded **Chat Model** (e.g., `google/gemma-2b-it`).
        4.  **Specify Embedding Model (Optional):** For the long-term memory (Vector Database) to function locally, you need to load a compatible embedding model in LM Studio and configure it for the embedding endpoint (e.g., `text-embedding-granite-embedding-278m-multilingual`). If this field is left empty, the chat model will be attempted for embeddings.
        5.  **Enable CORS:** **Crucially**, enable the **CORS** option in LM Studio's server settings. Without this, your browser will block the connection to the local server.

After making changes, click the `Save` button to apply them.

## 7. Troubleshooting / FAQ

### 7.1. AI Errors (e.g., "Failed to fetch from LM Studio", "Google Gemini API key not found")
*   **LM Studio CORS Issue:** If you see an error related to "Failed to fetch" or "CORS", it's likely that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is not enabled in your LM Studio server settings. Open LM Studio, go to the "Local Server" tab, and ensure the "CORS" checkbox is enabled.
*   **LM Studio URL/Model Mismatch:** Double-check that the `LM Studio API Endpoint` and `Model Name` in RealitySim AI's settings exactly match what's running in your LM Studio application.
*   **Google Gemini API Key:** Ensure your `API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is correctly set in your `.env.local` file and that you've restarted the application after setting it.
*   **General AI Errors:** If AI generation fails, check your internet connection (for Gemini), ensure the selected model is loaded/available, and review the console for more specific error messages.

### 7.2. Agents Not Moving or Performing Actions
*   **Imprisoned Agents:** Check the Agent Card. If an agent is `IMPRISONED`, they can only perform the 'Rest' action until their sentence is over.
*   **No Suitable Actions:** The AI might not find a suitable action based on the agent's current state, needs, and personality. Try giving a direct command (uncheck "Use AI" and type an exact action name like "Eat Food").
*   **AI Configuration:** Ensure your AI provider is correctly configured in the Settings modal.
*   **Needs are too low/high:** Agents prioritize survival. If their hunger, thirst, or fatigue are very low, they might not perform other actions.

### 7.3. Simulation Appears Frozen or Slow
*   **Processing Indicator:** If the `Processing step(s)...` indicator is visible, the AI is actively calculating. This can take a few seconds, especially for complex prompts or world generation. Wait for it to complete.
*   **Too Many Agents/Entities:** While the simulation is designed to handle many elements, a very large number of agents or entities might slow down performance, especially on less powerful machines.
*   **Browser Performance:** Ensure your browser is up to date and close other demanding tabs or applications.

### 7.4. Data Not Saving/Loading Correctly
*   **File Format:** Ensure that when loading, you are selecting a valid JSON file that was previously exported from RealitySim AI. Corrupted or incorrectly formatted JSON files will cause errors.
*   **Browser Permissions:** Ensure your browser has permission to download and upload files.

### 7.5. Agent Behavior is Unexpected
*   **Review Agent Card:** Check the agent's `Personality`, `Psyche`, `Beliefs`, and `Goals` on their Agent Card. These attributes heavily influence their decisions.
*   **Event Log:** The Event Log provides insights into why an agent chose a particular action. Look for messages indicating their thought process or reasons for failure.
*   **Psychoanalysis:** Generate a `Psychological Profile` for the agent to get a deep AI-driven analysis of their motivations and conflicts.
